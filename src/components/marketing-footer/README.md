# Marketing Footer
This is very simple example to show how fast and easy it is to create a marko component working with [building block](http://foundation.zurb.com/building-blocks/) UI Component library.



```
// Download the raw example
foundation blocks install marketing-site-footer

// create the component
yo marko
```

Then just move the html over to the template.marko file.
